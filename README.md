# Unit-Conversion

A simple unit conversion app that takes in a number from an input, and then converts that number between several 
Imperial and metric values. 

The "Convert" button calls a single function which adjusts the values of each conversion based on the number given by the user. 

Numbers can either be whole numbers, or a decimal can also be used.
